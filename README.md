remove ginkgotoxin from ginkgo seeds
Ginkgotoxin is a kind of toxic composition ,It will be unwanted constituents in standard Ginkgo biloba seeds extracts. 
This is for the quality control of ginkgo seeds extracts, it is important to establish an effective degradation method, with high catalytic efficiency and safety, to remove ginkgotoxin from ginkgo seeds. 
ginkgotoxin is oxidized easy and generated hazardous  compounds. 
In this research, three-factor and orthogonal experiments were used to optimize extraction of ginkgotoxin from Ginkgo biloba seeds. 
The results showed that SFE CO2 was the best solvent, with the highest remove rate for ginkgotoxin . 
On this basis, we measured  the time of remove toxic, temperature and SFE CO2 ratio using an orthogonal experiment.
temperature is at 45Â°C 
the time of remove toxic is 3.5 h, 
the remove rate of ginkgotoxin reached 99.5%. 
These results is very important for research on food safety.
